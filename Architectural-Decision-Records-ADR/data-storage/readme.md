# Architectural Decision Records for Data Storage

## Purpose
This document outlines key **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** related to **data storage** within our system. Our architecture incorporates multiple storage solutions, including **relational databases, NoSQL databases, object storage (S3), and plain file storage**, each chosen based on specific data and performance requirements.

The decisions recorded here reflect considerations around **scalability, performance, security, cost-efficiency, and long-term maintainability** of our data storage strategy.

## Scope
This ADR document focuses on:
- **Storage selection and justification** – Why we use relational databases, NoSQL databases, S3, and file storage.
- **Scalability, performance, and security** – Ensuring efficient data management while maintaining compliance and operational efficiency.
- **Key architectural decisions** – Documenting storage-related choices to maintain consistency and guide future enhancements.

Specific details about implementation are documented separately.

## Key Considerations
- **Relational vs. NoSQL Databases**: 
  - **Relational databases** handle structured, transactional data requiring **[ACID compliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)**.
  - **NoSQL databases** support flexible schema designs and **high-volume, distributed workloads**.
  
- **Object Storage & Plain File Storage**:
  - **S3** is used for **highly available, durable, and scalable object storage**, ideal for unstructured and archival data.
  - **Plain file storage** is used where direct file system access and low-latency reads/writes are needed.

- **Scalability & Performance**: 
  - **Databases** are optimized for query efficiency and transactional integrity.
  - **Object storage** scales horizontally to handle large datasets efficiently.
  - **File storage** is optimized for direct application use cases.

- **Security & Compliance**:
  - **Data encryption, access control, and retention policies** are enforced across all storage layers.
  - Compliance with **industry standards** (GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001) is maintained.

Relevant ADRs serve as a **historical record** of key **data storage** decisions, ensuring alignment with long-term architectural goals while enabling adaptability to future needs.
