# TESTING-001: Enforce Automated Validation of SQL Queries with Linting Tools

## Context
Ensuring SQL query correctness, readability, and maintainability is crucial for database integrity and system performance. Manual validation is error-prone and inconsistent, leading to issues such as syntax errors, inefficient queries, and non-standard formatting. Using automated linting tools for SQL validation helps enforce best practices, prevent mistakes, and maintain code consistency across all queries.

## Decision
1. **All SQL queries must be validated using an automated SQL linting tool** (e.g., SQLFluff, sql-lint).
2. **Linting must be enforced in the CI/CD pipeline**, preventing poorly formatted or invalid queries from being merged.
3. **Rules must cover**
<br>&emsp;3.1. **Syntax validation** – Prevent SQL syntax errors before execution.
<br>&emsp;3.1. **Formatting enforcement** – Ensure queries follow the defined style guide.
<br>&emsp;3.1. **Best practice adherence** – Catch inefficient queries and anti-patterns (e.g., `SELECT *`).
<br>&emsp;3.1. **Naming conventions** – Enforce `snake_case` for table and column names.
4. **Developers must run linting locally** before committing SQL changes.

## Example

> [!NOTE]
> An example based on using [SQLFluff](https://sqlfluff.com)

### **Configuration (`.sqlfluff`)**
```ini
[sqlfluff]
dialect = postgres
rules = L010,L011,L039
```

### Linting a SQL file
```bash
sqlfluff lint queries.sql
```

### Fixing formatting issues automatically
```bash
sqlfluff fix queries.sql
```

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes
- **Prevents syntax errors** before execution, reducing debugging time.
- **Ensures consistency** across all queries, improving readability and maintainability.
- **Enhances query performance** by enforcing best practices.
- **Automates validation,** reducing human error in SQL reviews.

### Potential Trade-offs
- **Requires initial setup** and developer adoption.
- **Linting rules must be periodically updated** to match evolving best practices.
- **Might require exceptions** for complex queries that don’t conform to standard rules.
